# Content Authenticity Protocol - A Blockchain-Based System for Human Produced Content Monetization

## 1. Introduction
This proposal introduces the Content Authenticity Protocol (CAP), a comprehensive system for monetizing content when accessed by agentic AI systems and Large Language Models (LLMs). The protocol combines a new legal framework—the Agentic AI Exclusion License (AAEL)—with a blockchain-based micropayment infrastructure and services to create an enforceable economic model for content creators in the AI era.

The system preserves free human access while requiring payment from AI systems, creating a sustainable equilibrium for an open internet.

# 2. Background

## 2.1  The Evolution of Web Content Monetization - The Advertising Era (1994-2005)
The web's initial monetization model borrowed from traditional media: advertising. Banner ads emerged in 1994, with HotWired selling the first display ad. The model evolved through several phases:

CPM Model (1994-1998): Fixed cost per thousand impressions, regardless of engagement
Click-Through Revolution (1998-2003): Pay-per-click models emerged, shifting risk to publishers
Contextual Advertising (2003-2010): Automated matching of ads to content, pioneered by Google AdSense

Publishers initially captured 80-90% of advertising revenue. By 2010, intermediary platforms captured 30-50% through their aggregation role.

## 2.2 The Evolution of Web Content Monetization - The Platform Economy (2005-2020)
Content monetization shifted from direct publisher relationships to platform-mediated models:

YouTube Partner Program (2007): 55/45 revenue split, democratizing video monetization
App Store Economy (2008): 70/30 model became industry standard
Creator Economy Platforms (2013-2020): Patreon, Substack, OnlyFans enabled direct monetization

This era saw individual creators earn from $100 to millions annually, but remained dependent on platform algorithms and policies. Platforms commoditized content while aggregating demand, extracting 15-50% of value.

## 2.3  The Evolution of Web Content Monetization - The AI Training Gold Rush (2020-Present)
A new dynamic emerged as AI companies began paying for training data:

Reddit: $60 million annually from AI companies (2024)
Shutterstock: $104 million in AI licensing revenue (2023)
X/Twitter: Restricted API access, implemented tiered pricing

Individual creators receive 0% of this value despite their content forming the foundation of AI capabilities.

## 2.4 The "Low Background Steel" Problem of Content
Just as low background steel—steel produced before 1945 free from radioactive contamination—becomes increasingly valuable for sensitive applications, human-generated content from before the AI era represents an irreplaceable resource.
Post-2022 content increasingly contains AI-generated text, creating a recursive pollution problem:

AI models trained on AI-generated content experience "model collapse"
Quality degradation compounds with each generation
Authentic human content becomes scarce and valuable
No reliable method exists to identify pre-AI content at scale

The internet faces a "content contamination" crisis analogous to atmospheric radiation: once AI-generated content proliferates, recovering pure human-generated training data becomes nearly impossible. Content created before 2022 represents the "low background" equivalent—increasingly rare and valuable for training robust AI systems.

## 2.5 AI Training and Copyright: The evolving legal battlefield

### 2.5.1 Fair use doctrine struggles with AI's novel challenges
Courts applying fair use doctrine to AI training are grappling with fundamental questions that traditional copyright law never anticipated. The four-factor fair use analysis has produced wildly inconsistent results across different courts and contexts.


# 3. Proposal Overview
## 3.1 System Components

The Content Authenticity Protocol consists of four integrated components:

Legal Framework: The Agentic AI Exclusion License (AAEL)
Detection Infrastructure: System for identifying agentic AI access to content and presenting a challenge
Payment System: Algorand-based micropayment infrastructure for paying content producers
Reputation System: Blockchain-verified content quality and authorship metrics

# 3.2 Economic Model
The protocol enables four three tiers:

Tier 0: Free human access and content indexing (e.g. web search)
Tier 1: Micropayments ($0.001-0.01 per access) for AI syustems
Tier 2: Bulk consumption model (negotiated pricing, based on member votes - TBD in the future)

# 4. The Agentic AI Exclusion License (AAEL)

## 4.1 The AAEL
See [AAEL v0.1](aael-v0_1.md) for the licence

## 4.2 Legal Enforcement Mechanisms
The AAEL creates multiple enforcement pathways:

Copyright Infringement: Unauthorized AI training constitutes reproduction and derivative work creation
Contract Breach: Access implies acceptance of license terms
DMCA Anti-Circumvention: Bypassing detection systems violates Section 1201
Unfair Competition: Commercial advantage from unlicensed training data

## 4.3 Statutory Damage Framework
The license establishes clear monetary penalties:

Minimum $5,000 USD per content item per unauthorized access
Treble damages for willful infringement
Injunctive relief including model deletion/retraining
Attorney's fees and costs

# 8. Foundation for the Fair Payment of Media (FYPM)

The Foundation for the Fair Payment of Media (FYPM) is a not-for-profit entity that acts as the steward of the CAP system and provides the micropayment infrastructure that underpins the CAP system.
