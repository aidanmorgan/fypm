This repository provides the start of a proposal for a new system to support the monetisation of content created by humans in the age of the agentic web. It cosnsits of:

* a licence that forbids the use of content unless a payment has been made to access (via a time-limited token) 
* a mechanism for a content producer to prove that they created the content and it has not been produced by generative ai
* a payment protocol that distributes payments made for access to content by agentic-ai's based on the reputation of content producers
* a system for detecting an agentic-ai is attempting to access content and blocking access until payment is made
* a not-for-profit foundation that owns the protocols and provides an implementation of the system that is not affiliated with any one organisation

# Overview of Protocol

[Overview](overview.md)

# Agentic AI Exclusion Licence (AAEL)

[Licence](aael-v0_1.md)

# Foundation for the Fair Payment of Media (FYPM)

[Principles](foundation.md)


# Technical Documentation

All documents are early stage DRAFT and require significant revision and input from experts. The ask is for people who are interested in contributing to open issues and discuss as a community how different aspects of the protocol should be implemented.

* [RFC-CAP-001: Content Authenticity Protocol](rfcs/reputation.md)
* [RFC-CAP-002: AI Agent Payment Distribution Protocol for Content Creators](rfcs/payment.md)
* [RFC-CAP-003: Hierarchical Identity Attestation and Content Signing Protocol](rfcs/identity.md)
* [RFC-CAP-004: Agentic AI Detection Protocol](rfcs/detection.md)

# Support Needed

* Reviews of content, filling in the (numerous) TBD's in the documents
