# The Human Content Compensation Protocol

This repository contains a proposal for the **Human Content Compensation Protocol (HCCP)**, a new open protocol designed to address a fundamental challenge of the modern internet: how to fairly compensate human creators for the value their work provides to Artificial Intelligence systems, especially in a world where agentic-AI systems are able to query search engines and load content dynamically to answer user questions.

As AI agents and Large Language Models (LLMs) consume vast amounts of online content for training and data analysis, the creators of that content are seldom compensated. HCCP proposes a new way forward by combining a legal framework with a decentralised technical system to create a new, equitable economic layer for the internet.

We are NOT anti-AI doomers, in fact, quite the opposite. We believe that AI has an incredible potential to advance humanity, what we are against is all reward only being in the hands of a few.

The core principle is simple: **human access to content remains free, while AI systems should pay**.

### Free content for humans?

Content creators already have a range of options for monetising their content, this proposal has no intention of changing any of this. 

The AAEL is intended to be a purely additive licence, it doesn't grant any additional rights or allowances, it acts as a "wrapper" licence on top of content creator's already existing licencing. 

The HCCP is not intended to be, nor should it ever be, a system for monetising content when it is consumed by humans.



## The Proposal

The proposal is detailed across several key documents that outline the philosophy, legal framework, and governance of the system.

*   The **[Project Overview](overview.md)** provides an introduction to the protocol, its core components, and the economic and legal background that makes this system necessary.

*   The **[Agentic AI Exclusion Licence (AAEL)](aael-v0_1.md)** is the legal licence of the protocol. It is a new licence that grants broad permissions for human use whilst explicitly requiring payment for any use by an AI system.

*   The **[Foundation for the Fair Payment of Media (FYPM)](foundation.md)** document outlines the principles and governance structure for the non-profit entity that will act as a neutral steward for the protocol.

*   The **[Economic Principles](economics.md)** document explains the financial model of the protocol, including dynamic micropayments, pooled settlement, and the future vision for DAO-governed bulk access agreements.


## Technical Specification

The technical implementation of the protocol is described in a series of interconnected Request for Comments (RFC) documents. These are early-stage drafts that outline the core systems, these documents are not technical in nature, but explain the core concepts of the systems and also outline a roadmap for how these systems may evolve over time.

*   **[RFC-HCCP-001: Human Content Compensation Protocol Identity System (HCCP-IDS)](rfcs/identity.md)**: Defines the system for how authors can establish a secure, decentralised identity and cryptographically sign their content.

*   **[RFC-HCCP-002: Human Content Compensation Protocol Reputation System (HCCP-REP)](rfcs/RFC-HCCP-002_HCCP-REP.md)**: Describes the adversarial system for attesting to content authenticity and establishing a trust score for participants, where AI agents are incentivised to challenge non-authentic content and AI vendors are incentivised to provide quality signals.

*   **[RFC-HCCP-003: Human Content Compensation Protocol AI Agent Detection System (HCCP-AID)](rfcs/detection.md)**: Outlines distinguishing between human users and AI agents, and for initiating a payment challenge.

*   **[RFC-HCCP-004: Human Content Compensation Protocol Payment Distribution System (HCCP-PDS)](rfcs/RFC-HCCP-004_HCCP-PDS.md)**: Details the concepts for collecting payments from AI agents and distributing them fairly to creators based on reputation and content access.


## This is an Early-Stage Proposal: We Need Your Help

It is critical to understand that this project is in its infancy. The documents in this repository represent a starting point â€” a very incomplete proposal intended to spark conversation and collaboration.

There are numerous open questions, missing details, and complex problems that have yet to be solved. The success of an open, foundational protocol like this depends on the effort of a dedicated community.

We are actively seeking support from developers, lawyers, economists, content creators, and AI researchers who are interested in helping us build a more sustainable and equitable future. If you are interested in contributing, please start by reviewing the documents, raising issues, and joining the discussion.
