# RFC-CAP-002: AI Agent Payment Distribution Protocol for Content Creators

**CAP:** 002  
**Title:** AI Agent Payment Distribution Protocol for Content Creators  
**Author:** CAP Working Group  
**Status:** Draft  
**Type:** Standards Track  
**Category:** Core  
**Created:** 2025-08-23  

## Abstract

The Content Authenticity Protocol Payment Distribution System (CAP-PDS) establishes a blockchain-based mechanism for distributing payments from AI agents to human content creators when verified human-created content is accessed for training or analysis purposes. The protocol implements an automated payment distribution model that triggers when AI agents are detected accessing CAP-protected content, requiring micropayments that are fairly distributed among content authors based on their reputation scores, content quality metrics, and access patterns. The system uses smart contracts on Algorand to ensure real-time, transparent distribution of AI agent payments to creators, with reputation-weighted multipliers that reward established authors while ensuring baseline compensation for emerging creators. This creates a sustainable economic model where AI companies compensate human creators for the value their content provides to machine learning systems.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

AI agents now routinely crawl, index, and learn from human-created content at scale, extracting billions of dollars in value without compensating creators. Content creators invest significant time and expertise producing high-quality, verified human content that becomes the foundation for AI training, yet receive no economic benefit when their work is consumed by machines. A new payment model is needed that automatically detects AI agent access and ensures fair compensation flows to human creators.

### 1.3 Goals

CAP-PDS aims to:
- Automatically distribute payments when AI agents access protected content
- Ensure fair compensation for verified human content creators
- Implement reputation-weighted distribution that rewards quality
- Enable real-time micropayments without intermediaries
- Create sustainable economics for human creativity in the AI era

### 1.4 Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

## 2. Terminology

**AI Agent Access**: Authenticated retrieval of CAP-protected content by an identified AI system  
**Agent Payment**: Micropayment submitted by AI agent for content access  
**Distribution Pool**: Aggregated payments from AI agents awaiting distribution  
**Creator Share**: Portion of payment allocated to specific content creator  
**Reputation Multiplier**: Scaling factor based on author's CAP-001 reputation score  
**Quality Score**: Composite metric of content value for AI training  
**Access Token**: Cryptographic proof of payment granting temporary access  

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Core Components

The payment distribution system consists of six integrated smart contracts:

1. **AI Detection Gateway**: Identifies AI agents and triggers payment requirements
2. **Payment Collector**: Receives and validates AI agent micropayments
3. **Distribution Calculator**: Computes creator shares using reputation weighting
4. **Settlement Engine**: Executes automatic payments to content creators
5. **Reputation Bridge**: Interfaces with CAP-001 reputation scores
6. **Analytics Tracker**: Records AI access patterns and payment metrics

### 3.2 Payment Flow Architecture

```
AI Agent → Content Request → Detection Gateway
            ↓                    ↓
        AI Detected → HTTP 402 Payment Required
            ↓                    
      Submit Payment → Payment Collector
            ↓
    Verify Payment → Issue Access Token
            ↓
    Access Granted → Record Access Event
            ↓
    Distribution Calculator → Compute Shares
            ↓
    Settlement Engine → Pay Creators
```

## 4. AI Agent Payment Requirements

### 4.1 Payment Triggering

When an AI agent is detected accessing content as per [RFC-CAP-004: Agentic AI Detection Protocol](detection.md)

### 4.2 Pricing Model for AI Access

Dynamic pricing based on content value and creator reputation:

```python
def calculate_ai_payment(content_value, content_length, creator_reputation, agent_type):
    # Base rate per 1000 words
    base_rates = {
        # some form of automatically scaling base payment over time
    }
    
    base_payment = base_rates.get(agent_type, 0.05)
    
    # Scale by content length
    word_multiplier = content_length / 1000
    
    # Quality adjustment (0.5x to 2x)
    quality_multiplier = 0.5 + (content_value * 1.5)
    
    # Reputation bonus (1x to 3x)
    reputation_multiplier = 1.0 + (creator_reputation / 2000)
    
    final_payment = (
        base_payment * 
        word_multiplier * 
        quality_multiplier * 
        min(3.0, reputation_multiplier)
    )
    
    return max(0.01, final_payment)  # Minimum 0.01 ALGO
```

## 5. Payment Distribution Model

### 5.1 Creator-Focused Distribution

Unlike traditional platforms, creators receive the majority of payments

```python
def distribute_ai_payment(payment_amount, content_id, access_metadata):
    """
    Distribution model for AI agent payments
    Creators receive 90% of payment
    """
    distribution = {
        'content_creator': payment_amount * 0.90,  # 90% to creator
        'cap_treasury': payment_amount * 0.07,     # 7% platform
        'validators': payment_amount * 0.03        # 3% validators
    }
        
    return distribution
```

### 5.2 Multi-Author Distribution

For collaborative content, distribute based on contribution (needs to be part of the attestation in [RFC-CAP-003: Hierarchical Identity Attestation and Content Signing Protocol](identity.md):


### 5.3 Reputation-Based Multipliers

Reward established creators while supporting newcomers:

```python
def calculate_reputation_multiplier(reputation_score):
    """
    Logarithmic scaling to avoid winner-take-all dynamics
    Range: 1.0x to 2.5x multiplier
    """
    if reputation_score < 500:
        return 1.0  # New creators get base rate
    elif reputation_score < 1500:
        return 1.0 + (reputation_score - 500) * 0.0005  # Up to 1.5x
    elif reputation_score < 2500:
        return 1.5 + (reputation_score - 1500) * 0.0007  # Up to 2.2x
    else:
        return min(2.5, 2.2 + (reputation_score - 2500) * 0.0001)
```

## 6. Payment Processing

### 6.1 Block-based Settlement

Payments are distributed in blocks once verified, also for performance. TBD 


## 7. Smart Contract Implementation

### 7.1 Algorand Payment Distribution Contract

* This should be versioned and updates to the contract are managed by the foundation after voting by the members.

### 7.2 Access Token Generation

See [ RFC-CAP-004: Agentic AI Detection Protocol](detection.md)

- **Payment Verification**: On-chain confirmation before access
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum payments per AI agent per hour

### 10.2 Anti-Fraud Measures


## 15. Future Enhancements

### 15.1 Advanced Features
