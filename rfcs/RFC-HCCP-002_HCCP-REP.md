# RFC-HCCP-002: Human Content Compensation Protocol Reputation System (HCCP-REP)

**HCCP:** 002  
**Title:** Human Content Compensation Protocol Reputation System (HCCP-REP)  
**Status:** Draft  
**Created:** 2025-08-23  

## Abstract

The Human Content Compensation Protocol Reputaiton System (HCCP-REP) establishes a blockchain-based reputation system for verifying human-created content versus AI-generated content through consensus mechanisms. Authors attest their content creation without Large Language Models (LLMs), while other autonomous systems are incentivized to challenge authenticity by staking cryptocurrency. The protocol employs consensus for voting, a reputation scoring system with decay periods, and economic incentives aligned through progressive staking requirements. Failed challenges result in staked ALGO loss and reputation damage, while successful challenges distribute rewards based on author reputation curves. The system implements ban mechanics with escalating stake requirements and maintains a core HCCP wallet for sustainable challenge payouts.

## Conceptual Overview

Trust is the currency of any healthy ecosystem. The reputation protocol is conceived as an adversarial system, not to foster conflict, but to forge resilience. Just as a scientific theory is strengthened by rigorous attempts to disprove it, a claim of authenticity in this system is strengthened by the constant possibility of being challenged. 

Fundamentally for HCCP and the goals of the FTPM to succed, we need a mechanism to identify content producers that are ariticially claiming that their work is of their own creation, when in fact it has been generated by AI, furthering the problem of model-collapse.

To provide an objective measure of value, each piece of content within the HCCP network has a Quality Rank. This rank is determined using a system analogous to Google's PageRank, where the **author's reputation score provides a foundational weight**. This score is then modified by a graph of content relationships. Factors include: citations by other high-reputation authors, inclusion in high-quality datasets, and potentially, the frequency of access by high-reputation AI agents. This creates a virtuous cycle where high-quality, foundational content from reputable authors is recognized and valued more highly by the network.


## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Goals

The goals of the Human Content Compensation Protocol Reputation System (HCCP-REP) are to:

*   Create a decentralized, trust-based system for verifying claims of content human authorship authenticity made via HCCP-IDS.
*   Establish a fair and transparent economic model, based on staking, to incentivize truthful attestations and high-quality challenges.
*   Implement a mathematical, scoring system to quantify the reputation of all participants over time.
*   Provide a consensus mechanism for resolving disputes impartially.

### 1.4 Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.


## 3. Progressive Reputation Bootstrap

The reputation system cannot launch with full adversarial dynamics from day one. Trust systems require time to develop, communities need education about the mechanisms, and the economic incentives must be proven before participants will risk significant stakes. This section outlines how the HCCP reputation system will progressively evolve from simple content attestation to the full consensus model, allowing the ecosystem to mature naturally while maintaining security at each stage.

### 3.1 Phase One

In the beginning, the reputation system operates on an assumption of good faith. Creators simply attest that their content was created without LLM assistance, and this attestation is taken at face value. There are no challenges, and no complex consensus mechanisms. This allows creators to begin participating without fear of immediate adversarial action. Creators who participate early and consistently establish a "founder's advantage" – their early, unchallenged attestations become increasingly valuable as the system matures and these historical records become harder to fake.

The reputation score in this phase is deliberately simple: one point per attestation, with bonuses for consistency and identity verification strength. A creator who attests content daily for months builds a stronger foundation than one who dumps a hundred attestations in a single day. This temporal distribution becomes crucial later when the system needs to distinguish between authentic creators and those attempting to game the system.

### 3.2 Phase Two

As the creator community grows and participants become familiar with the concepts, the system should introduce its first social concept: endorsements. This phase maintains the non-adversarial nature while beginning to build a web of trust between creators. Endorsements cost a trivial amount of ALGO (or reputation?), just enough to prevent spam but not enough to discourage genuine support.

Creators learn to evaluate each other's work, to recognize quality, and to build relationships. The endorsement graph that emerges becomes a powerful signal of authenticity – fake accounts can attest content, but building a natural-looking endorsement network is hard.

During this phase, AI agents are able to participate as passive observers. When an AI agent accesses content, it can optionally mark it as "useful", or "machine generated" at no cost. This creates an early feedback loop between creators and AI systems without any adversarial dynamics. AI companies are incentivized to provide signals on quality/usefulness because it earns them future discounts, while creators benefit from understanding what content has genuine utility for AI training.

### 3.3 Phase Three

With a foundation of positive interactions established, the system introduces its first negative signals through a flagging mechanism. Crucially, these early disputes require no financial stakes. Any verified creator can flag content they suspect is AI-generated, triggering a review process but risking no money.

The resolution mechanism in this phase is deliberately human-centric. Flagged content enters a review queue where other creators can examine the evidence and cast non-binding votes. While these votes don't directly determine outcomes, they signal community sentiment and help train the machine learning models that will later assist in automated detection. Authors who successfully defend against flags receive reputation bonuses, while those who ignore flags suffer minor penalties. This dataset is intended to be curated by the FYPM foundation and be provided to help with training AI content generation tools. 

This phase also introduces the concept of "reputation at risk." While no money is staked, creators must risk reputation to flag content. Frivolous flagging results in reputation loss, while successful identification of AI content earns reputation gains. This creates the first real cost to false accusations while keeping the stakes manageable.

### 3.4 Phase Four

The transition is gradual – stakes begin at minimal levels (e.g. 0.01 ALGO) and challenges are limited to established creators with reputation scores above a threshold. This prevents newcomers from being immediately exposed to financial risk while ensuring challengers have skin in the game beyond money.

The resolution mechanism evolves to incorporate multiple inputs. Community voting maintains the highest weight, but automated detection signals and a validators also contribute. This hybrid approach prevents any single approach from being gamed while maintaining human judgment as the primary arbiter. The seven-day escrow period for challenges allows thorough investigation while preventing indefinite locks on creator funds.


### 3.5 Phase Five

With the community educated and the basic mechanics proven, the system transitions to its full adversarial model. Stakes become dynamic, scaling with author reputation according to the formula that makes challenging established creators exponentially more expensive. AI agents are granted full participation rights, able to initiate challenges with their own stakes.

This phase sees the emergence of specialized roles within the ecosystem. "Detective" AI agents, trained specifically to identify AI-generated content, compete to find fraud for profit. "Defense" agents help creators gather evidence to defend against challenges. These specialized participants create a robust, self-policing ecosystem where fraud becomes increasingly difficult and expensive.

The reputation algorithm reaches its full complexity, incorporating challenge survival rates, AI utility scores, citation graphs, and temporal consistency.

### 3.6 Phase Six

In its final evolution, the reputation system becomes fully self-governing. The parameters that were initially set by the FYPM foundation – stake formulas, reputation weights, challenge resolution mechanisms – all become subject to DAO governance. 

The four-tier content classification system is introduced, acknowledging the reality of AI-assisted creation while maintaining higher value for purely human work. This nuanced approach prevents the system from becoming binary and rigid, instead embracing the spectrum of human-AI collaboration while maintaining clear incentives for human creativity.


### 3.7 Migration Triggers and Safety Mechanisms

The progression between phases is not time-based but milestone-based. Each phase transition requires meeting specific criteria: user thresholds, content volume minimums, fraud rates below acceptable levels, and community approval through governance votes. This ensures the system only advances when it's truly ready, not according to an arbitrary schedule.

Safety mechanisms are built into each transition. If fraud rates spike or community confidence drops, the system can pause progression or even roll back to a previous phase. Reputation earned in earlier phases is preserved and valued, creating an incentive for early participation while protecting those investments if the system needs to retreat.


## Future Optionality: Reputation from Verified Credentials

A future evolution of the reputation system could move beyond the purely adversarial challenge model to incorporate an author's real-world, verified credentials. Using the HCCP-IDS protocol, an author could prove they hold specific qualifications (e.g., a PhD in a relevant field, a medical license, a professional certification). The reputation system could then grant a significant, non-adversarial reputation boost to authors who verifiably link these credentials to their identity. This would create a powerful incentive for credentialed experts to contribute high-quality, authoritative content, and would allow the system to signal not just trustworthiness, but also expertise.

## Future Optionality: AI Agent Quality Signal Contribution

The protocol could evolve to allow AI agents that access content to contribute back to the quality scoring system as active participants in the ecosystem. When an AI agent successfully incorporates content into its training or uses it for generation, it could provide a cryptographically signed quality signal back to the network. This signal would indicate that the content met certain utility thresholds for professional AI applications.

To incentivize this feedback mechanism, AI agents that consistently provide quality signals could receive reduced access fees through a tiered discount system. For example:
- AI agents with no quality signal history pay the full negotiated price
- Agents that provide regular quality signals receive a 10-20% discount on future content access
- Agents with exceptional signal accuracy (verified through subsequent community consensus) could earn up to 30% discounts

This creates a symbiotic relationship where AI systems become stakeholders in maintaining content quality. The quality signals from AI agents would be particularly valuable as they represent real-world utility validation - content that is genuinely useful for training state-of-the-art models would naturally receive higher quality scores. This mechanism would also help identify emerging high-value content domains and could guide creators toward producing content that has genuine utility in the AI ecosystem.

The implementation would require careful design to prevent manipulation, potentially including:
- Minimum stake requirements for quality signals to prevent spam
- Delayed revelation of discounts to prevent gaming
- Cross-validation with other quality metrics to detect anomalies
- Reputation penalties for AI agents that consistently provide signals that diverge from community consensus

## Future Optionality: Tiered Content Classification for Human-AI Collaboration

The protocol could evolve beyond the binary classification of "human-created" versus "AI-generated" to recognize the reality of modern content creation. A future implementation could introduce a tiered attestation system that acknowledges different levels of AI involvement while still preserving value for human creativity and oversight.

Proposed content tiers could include:
- **Tier 1: Pure Human Creation** - Content created entirely by humans without any LLM assistance (highest reputation weight and compensation rates)
- **Tier 2: AI-Assisted Human Creation** - Content where LLMs were used as tools (spell-checking, grammar, research assistance) but core ideas and structure originate from humans (moderate reputation weight, 70-80% of Tier 1 rates)
- **Tier 3: Human-Reviewed AI Generation** - Content initially generated by LLMs but substantially reviewed, edited, and verified by humans (lower reputation weight, 40-50% of Tier 1 rates)
- **Tier 4: Collaborative Human-AI Creation** - Content created through iterative human-AI collaboration where contributions are intertwined (variable rates based on demonstrated human value-add)

Authors would declare the appropriate tier when attesting their content, with different stake requirements for each tier. Tier 1 declarations would require the highest stakes (as they claim no AI involvement), while lower tiers would have proportionally lower stake requirements. This system recognizes that:

1. **Economic Reality**: Many creators already use AI tools to enhance productivity, and completely excluding such content could diminish the pool of valuable human-curated information
2. **Value Preservation**: Human judgment, curation, and verification still add substantial value even when AI is involved in the creation process
3. **Transparency**: Clear labeling allows AI systems to make informed decisions about training data quality and provenance
4. **Incentive Alignment**: Higher compensation for pure human content incentivizes original thinking while still recognizing the value of human-AI collaboration

The challenge mechanism would need to adopt adapt accordingly - challengers could dispute not just authenticity but also the declared tier. For instance, content claimed as Tier 1 but detected to have LLM signatures could be challenged and potentially reclassified to a lower tier. This creates a more granular and realistic framework that acknowledges the spectrum of human-AI interaction in content creation while maintaining the protocol's core goal of preserving and compensating human creativity.
