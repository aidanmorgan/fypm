# Foundation for the Fair Payment of Media (FYPM)

## 1. The Foundational Principles of FYPM

The work of the Foundation is driven by a set of core principles that provide the ethical, legal, and philosophical background for its mission. These principles are designed to guide the development of a digital ecosystem that is both innovative and just.

### 1.1 Principle 1: AI in Service of Humanity
The development of advanced artificial intelligence must be directed toward the benefit of all humanity. This foundational principle, shared by leading research organizations and enshrined in international ethical frameworks, states that technological progress is not an end in itself, but a means to enhance well-being.

The UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence provides a global standard for this vision, asserting that AI systems must respect, protect, and promote fundamental human rights, diversity, and inclusiveness. In this context, "benefit" is defined not as mere economic efficiency or shareholder value, but as the equitable distribution of technological gains and the active prevention of harm. To ignore equitable access is to risk creating technologies that amplify existing societal inequalities, perpetuate harmful biases, and further marginalize vulnerable communities.

FYPM's mission is a direct and practical application of this principle. By ensuring that the creators who provide the foundational data for AI systems are recognized and compensated, the Foundation works to ensure that the benefits of AI are shared with those who make them possible. It is a stand against a future where technological gains are concentrated in the hands of a few, and a commitment to a model where AI serves to empower and sustain the human creativity that is critical to our culture.

### 1.2 Principle 2: The Inherent Right to Compensation
Content producers possess a fundamental right to be fairly compensated when their work is incorporated into artificial intelligence systems. This principle moves beyond a simple business consideration to assert a moral and legal imperative for remuneration.

The current legal landscape surrounding the use of copyrighted works for AI training is defined by conflict and uncertainty. High-profile litigation demonstrates that the "fair use" doctrine is not a reliable defense for AI developers, particularly when their resulting product serves as a market substitute for the original works used in its training.

The economic stakes are equally high. The rise of generative AI is causing a profound disruption in the creative industries, with many knowledge-worker roles facing significant devaluation. While AI can be a powerful tool for augmenting creativity , there is widespread and justified concern that without a mechanism for compensation, it will lead to a race to the bottom, eroding creator livelihoods.

The current paradigm of litigation is a reactive and inadequate response to a problem of unprecedented scale and technical complexity. The core issue is not a failure of law in the abstract, but the absence of technical infrastructure capable of managing consent and licensing at the scale of the internet. FYPM provides a proactive, market-based solution. By engineering a technical framework for granular, automated, and consent-based licensing, the Foundation offers a clear and lawful pathway that moves beyond the courtroom. This system provides AI developers with legal certainty and ethical access to high-quality training data, while establishing a direct and reliable revenue stream for creators. It transforms an adversarial relationship into a mutually agreeable one, creating the conditions for a new, more efficient legal and economic future to emerge.

### 1.3 Principle 3: The Imperative of Open and Decentralized Systems
To ensure fairness, transparency, and resilience, the infrastructure for tracking and compensating content must be open and decentralized. A centralized system, controlled by a single corporate or governmental entity, would inevitably replicate the power imbalances and gatekeeping dynamics of the Web2 era, creating a single point of failure and a be at the whim of vested interests.

The principles of decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 technologies offer a superior architectural model for this future. By leveraging technologies like blockchain, these systems can remove costly intermediaries, enhance security through cryptographic immutability, and provide radical transparency in all transactions. When applied to the creator economy, this model is transformative. It empowers creators with direct ownership, greater control, and true financial independence over their work. It ensures fair compensation by programmatically enforcing royalty agreements and minimizing the fees extracted by platforms.

The goal is to construct a piece of foundational digital infrastructure that functions as a trusted public commons, much like the open-source ecosystems stewarded by organizations like the Linux Foundation. An open, decentralized architecture is the only way to build a system that can earn the trust of all stakeholders—creators, developers, and the public—and serve as a neutral, censorship-resistant, and globally accessible utility for the new creative economy.

### 1.4 Principle 4: Preserving the Integrity of the Digital Commons
The future of the open internet is threatened by the erosion of trust that accompanies the proliferation of unattributed AI-generated content. A healthy digital ecosystem depends on the ability of its participants to determine the origin and authenticity of information. Without a reliable mechanism for content provenance, our shared digital commons becomes polluted with synthetic media, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish fact from fiction, and authentic expression from automated generation.

This "trust deficit" has profound consequences to our communities. It creates the spread of disinformation, enables new forms of fraud and manipulation, and undermines the perceived value of all digital content. If consumers cannot trust what they see, read, and hear online, they will inevitably disengage, harming the entire digital economy and fracturing our shared digital spaces.

Therefore, the mechanism for fair payment must be inextricably linked to a mechanism for establishing authorship. The very act of registering content to claim ownership and define licensing terms creates a verifiable record of its origin. By building this infrastructure, FYPM not only enables compensation but also provides a foundational layer of authenticity for the digital world. The foundation aims to align with critical industry efforts like the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), contributing to the broader goal of building a more transparent, trustworthy, and resilient internet.


# 2. Governance, Structure, and Operations
The technical mechanism of FYPM requires an institutional steward that is neutral, transparent, and commitment to the mission. The Foundation for the Fair Payment of Media is that institution, structured to earn and maintain the trust of the global community it serves.

## 2.1 A Non-Profit, Mission-Driven Entity
The Foundation is incorporated as a non-profit organization, a structure chosen to align its legal and financial duties with the broader interest of the internet. This status is essential for its role, ensuring that its decisions are guided by its mission rather than by profit motives.

The Foundation's financial principles are : all revenue generated—whether from membership dues, nominal transaction fees, or philanthropic grants—will be used exclusively to operate and advance the Foundation's services. This includes maintaining the decentralized infrastructure, funding core staff, supporting legal defense for the ecosystem and on behalf of content creators who's ownership has been violated, and developing community support programs. This non-profit commitment stands in contrast to for-profit or hybrid models, ensuring that the Foundation's primary beneficiary is, and always will be, the global community of creators and the health of the digital commons.

## 3.2 A Collaborative Governance Model
A technical system designed to serve a diverse global community cannot be governed by a top-down, hierarchical structure. The evolving distrust between content creators and AI developers requires a governance model that is demonstrably neutral and collaborative. 

To achieve this, the Foundation adopts a meritocratic governance model heavily inspired by the long and successful history of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). This model, often described as a "do-ocracy," ensures that influence is earned through contribution, not granted by title or financial stake. Key roles within this structure include:

Users: The broad community of creators and AI developers who utilize the FYPM system. Their feedback and adoption are the ultimate drivers of the ecosystem's success.

Contributors: Community members who actively contribute to the project through activities such as writing documentation, identifying bugs, or proposing technical improvements.

Committers: Experienced and trusted contributors who are granted direct write access to the project's technical repositories. This status is earned through a sustained record of meritorious contributions and is a prerequisite for formal technical governance.

Project Management Committees (PMCs): These are the primary technical governing bodies of the Foundation. Separate PMCs, composed of committers elected by their peers, will oversee the evolution of distinct protocols. The PMCs are responsible for all technical decision-making within their domain.

Board of Directors: The Board provides corporate and financial oversight for the Foundation as a legal entity. It is elected by the Foundation's members and is responsible for ensuring legal compliance and fiscal health. Crucially, the Board delegates all technical direction and decision-making authority to the PMCs, ensuring that governance remains close to the work itself.

All technical decisions within the PMCs are made through a collaborative, consensus-based process. This ensures that the evolution of the FYPM protocols is the product of the collective expertise of the community, fostering a resilient and innovative ecosystem that is independent of undue commercial influence.

## 3.3 Intellectual Property
To ensure the long-term integrity and interoperability of FYPM, the Foundation will act as the steward of the intellectual property that defines its core protocols. All individuals who contribute code or technical specifications to the project will be required to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), a standard practice in major open-source foundations.

The CLA grants the Foundation a license to the contributed IP, with the Foundation retaining the ultimate rights over the collective work. This policy is not intended to claim ownership of individual contributions for commercial exploitation, but to serve a critical protective function. By holding the core IP, the Foundation can prevent the fragmentation of its standards. It ensures that no single company or entity can "fork" the protocol and create a competing, incompatible system that would undermine the network effects and universality of the public commons. This stewardship model, successfully employed by organizations like the Linux Foundation, guarantees that the FYPM protocols remain a single, unified, and open standard for the benefit of all. The protocols themselves will be made available to the public under a permissive open-source license to encourage adoption and integration.

# Helping Drive the Creative Economy
The emergence of generative artificial intelligence has presented the global digital ecosystem with a profound choice: between a future where human creativity is devalued and its outputs are strip-mined without consent or compensation, and a future where technology amplifies innate capacity for creation. The Foundation for the Fair Payment of Media is founded on the conviction that the latter future is not only possible, but essential.

The FYPM offers a comprehensive solution—an integrated architecture for provenance, rights, and compensation, stewarded by a neutral, non-profit, and community-governed foundation. This is not a proposal to halt technological progress, but to place it on a more sustainable and ethical footing. It is a framework designed to transform an ambiguous conflict into a collaboration.

This cannot be achieved in isolation. It requires a broad coalition of stakeholders working in concert toward a shared goal. 

The Foundation for the Fair Payment of Media therefore extends an open invitation to all who share our vision:

To Creators, Artists, and Publishers: Join us to register your work, and build a future where your creative contributions are verifiably attributed and fairly valued.

To AI Developers and Researchers: Partner with us to access a vast and growing library of legally clear training data, reducing your legal risk, improving the quality of your models, and contributing to a healthier, open internet.

To Platforms, Institutions, and Policymakers: Collaborate with us to adopt and promote these open standards, helping to build the foundational infrastructure for a more transparent, innovative, and trustworthy digital world.

Together, we can chart a course for a new creative economy—one where technological innovation and human creativity are not adversarial forces, but mutually reinforce progress.
